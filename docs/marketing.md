## Messages for Influencer

### Outreach Message Template 1: Beta Testing Invitation
Hi [Influencer's Name],

```
I’m excited to invite you to be part of the exclusive beta testing group for Threadlytics, 
a new SaaS platform designed for Threads influencers. This is a chance to get early access to cutting-edge analytics, 
scheduling, and AI-powered features tailored for creators like you.

As a thank you, we’d offer you a custom promo code so you can share Threadlytics with your audience. 
For every subscriber who signs up using your code, 
you’ll earn a recurring revenue share of 30-40% of their subscription fee — paid out regularly as we agree.

This is a great opportunity to grow alongside the platform and receive ongoing income for empowering your followers.

Would you be interested in joining the beta group and discussing details?

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
